# Visual Studio 19 Python Snippets
## Introduction:
* This repository contains **python snippets** from many famous python IDE's *(VS Code, Vim, Pycharm, Sublime etc)* compiled for **Visual Studio 2019**.
* This snippets package will make you more productive working with **Python in Visual Studio 2019** as it helped me.
> These snippets can be used in Visual Studio 2019 just like builtin snippets.
> The snippets included in this repository are shown in [List of Snippets Section](https://github.com/haaks1998/Visual-Studio-19-Python-Snippets#List-of-snippets)
> The procedure of using these snippets is explained in [Usage Section](https://github.com/haaks1998/Visual-Studio-19-Python-Snippets#Usage). 
> The procedure of installing snippets in your Visual Studio 2019 is explained in [Installation Section](https://github.com/haaks1998/Visual-Studio-19-Python-Snippets#Installation)
